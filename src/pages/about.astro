  <p>
    Hello! I'm Sameer, a full-stack developer based in Kitchener, Ontario. With
    over three years of experience, I specialize in crafting robust and scalable
    web applications that deliver seamless user experiences.
  </p>

  <p>
    My passion lies in bringing ideas to life across the entire stack. On the
    frontend, I build responsive and pixel-perfect interfaces primarily with
    ReactJS and Next.js, leveraging tools like Redux, TailwindCSS, and
    Bootstrap. For the backend, I work with Node.js and Express, managing data
    with MongoDB and PostgreSQL, and designing efficient REST APIs.
  </p>

  <p>
    I thrive in agile environments, collaborating closely with cross-functional
    teams to tackle complex challenges and optimize performance. From developing
    user-friendly interfaces to deploying applications on cloud platforms with
    CI/CD pipelines, I enjoy every step of the development lifecycle.
  </p>

  <p>
    Beyond the code, I'm constantly exploring new technologies and sharing
    insights into the world of web development. You can reach out to me via
    linkedIn or connect with me on GitHub.
